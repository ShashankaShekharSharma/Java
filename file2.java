/*
1. Primitive Data Types: These are the most basic data types in Java and store simple values directly. They are:
byte: 8-bit signed integer.
short: 16-bit signed integer.
int: 32-bit signed integer.
long: 64-bit signed integer.
float: 32-bit floating-point number.
double: 64-bit floating-point number.
char: 16-bit Unicode character.
boolean: Represents true or false values.
2. Reference Data Types: These data types store references (memory addresses) to objects. They are used for storing complex data structures and user-defined types. Examples include:
Classes: User-defined data types that can contain variables (fields) and methods.
Arrays: Used to store a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type.
Interfaces: Define a contract that classes can implement.
Enums: A special type of class that represents a group of constants.
Strings: Represents a sequence of characters.
